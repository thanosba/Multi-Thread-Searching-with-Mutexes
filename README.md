# Multi-Thread-Searching-with-Mutexes
In computer science, the reentrant mutex (recursive mutex, recursive lock) is particular type of mutual exclusion (mutex) device that may be locked multiple times by the same process/thread, without causing a deadlock.  While any attempt to perform the "lock" operation on an ordinary mutex (lock) would either fail or block when the mutex is already locked, on a recursive mutex this operation will succeed if and only if the locking thread is the one that already holds the lock. Typically, a recursive mutex tracks the number of times it has been locked, and requires equally many unlock operations to be performed before other threads may lock it.
